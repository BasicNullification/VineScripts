# Source Files

These are the unminified source files for the bookmarklets. Use these if you want to edit or understand how they work.

To use as actual bookmarks, use the minified `.min.js` versions in the parent folder instead. Comments and verbose formatting in these files can sometimes cause issues when used directly as bookmarks.

## Editing
Feel free to modify these files. Once you've made changes, minify them and update the `.min.js` versions in the parent folder.
